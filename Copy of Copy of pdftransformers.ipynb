Edema resulting from renal dysfunction often appears initially in parts of the body containing loose connective tissue, such as the eyelids; periorbital edema is thus a characteristic finding in severe renal disease. With pulmonary edema, the lungs are often two to three times their normal weight, and sectioning yields frothy, blood-tinged fluid—a mixture of air, edema, and extravasated red cells. Brain edema can be localized or generalized depending on the nature and extent of the pathologic process or injury. The swollen brain exhibits narrowed sulci and distended gyri, which are compressed by the unyielding skull (Chapter 28). Effusions involving the pleural cavity (hydrothorax), the pericardial cavity (hydropericardium), or the peritoneal cavity (hydroperitoneum or ascites) are common in a wide range of clinical settings. Transudative effusions are typically protein-poor, translucent, and straw colored; an exception are peritoneal effusions caused by lymphatic blockage (chylous effusion), which may be milky due to the presence of lipids absorbed from the gut. In contrast, exudative effusions are protein-rich and often cloudy due to the presence of white cells.\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["\"\\nEdema is a condition characterized by swelling due to an accumulation of fluid in the body's tissues. It is most commonly seen in subcutaneous tissues, the lungs, and the brain. It is easily recognized by its gross appearance and microscopically, it is appreciated as clearing and separation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and subtle cell swelling. Edema can be diffuse or more conspicuous in regions with high hydrostatic pressures and its distribution is often influenced by gravity. It can also be caused by renal dysfunction and appears initially in parts of the body containing loose connective tissue, such as the eyelids. With pulmonary edema, the lungs are often two to three times their normal weight and sectioning yields frothy, blood-tinged fluid.
