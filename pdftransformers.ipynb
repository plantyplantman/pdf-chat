      "Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is most often seen as a response to infection or inflammatory injury of the lungs. It has been associated with viral and bacterial pneumonias, inhaled toxins, drugs, connective tissue disease, and graft- versus-host disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Patients present with cough and dyspnea and have patchy subpleural or peribronchial areas of airspace consolidation radiographically. Histologically, it is characterized by the presence of polypoid plugs of loose organizing connective tissue (Masson bodies) within alveolar ducts, alveoli, and often bronchioles.\n",

      "\"Often, a bacterial infection follows an upper respiratory tract viral infection. Bacterial invasion of the lung paren- chyma causes the alveoli to be filled with an inflammatory exudate, thus causing consolidation (“solidification”) of the pulmonary tissue. Predisposing conditions include extremes of age, chronic diseases (conges- tive heart failure, COPD, and diabetes), congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, and decreased or absent splenic function. Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is the most common cause of community-acquired acute pneumonia. Examination of Gram-stained sputum is an important step in the diagnosis of acute pneumonia. The presence of numer- ous neutrophils containing the typical gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci supports the diagnosis of pneu- mococcal pneumonia, but it must be remembered that S. pneumoniae is a part of the endogenous flora in 20% of adults, and therefore false-positive results may be obtained. Isolation of pneumococci from blood cultures is more specific but less sensitive (in the early phase of illness, only 20% to 30% of patients have positive blood cultures). Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus influenzae is a pleomorphic, gram-negative organ- ism that occurs in encapsulated and nonencapsulated forms. There are six serotypes of the encapsulated form (types a to f), of which type b is the most virulent.

      "Obstructive lung diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and bronchiectasis. COPD has two major clinicopathologic manifestations, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Asthma is distinguished from chronic bronchitis and emphysema by the presence of reversible bronchospasm. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases.” Centriacinar emphysema and panacinar (panlobular) emphysema are two types of emphysema.\n",
